A TypeScript library and CLI tool for managing [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/) SDK repositories. This tool helps you generate, monitor, and sync SDK repositories with their corresponding OpenAPI specifications.

## Features

- üîÑ Clone and monitor SDK repositories for changes
- üìÑ Automatic OpenAPI specification file handling
- ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible configuration using cosmiconfig
- üîí Support for both HTTPS and SSH git URLs
- üöÄ Easy-to-use CLI interface
- üì¶ Can be used as a library in your own projects
- üéØ Default configurations for easier usage
- üîë Integration with Stainless API for publishing changes

## About this project

This project was entirely built using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). It took an entire day with careful prompting to cover various use-cases and write the appropriate tests and documentation. No human wrote any part of the `src` code, although the README has been hand-polished.

## Installation

```bash
npm install stainless-tools -g
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Write access to the SDK repository you want to generate
- A Stainless API key. This is the same API key used for automating updates via [GitHub Action](https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/guides/automate-updates#option-1-github-action-recommended)
- Have access to the generated SDK Repo as it will be checked out: `https://github.com/stainless-sdks/<project_name>-<language>`

#### Environment Setup

Before using the tool, you need to set up your Stainless API key. You can do this in two ways:

1. Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
STAINLESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Or export it in your shell:
```bash
export STAINLESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Configuration

The tool uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) for configuration management. You can define your configuration in any of these ways:

- A `stainless` property in package.json
- A `.stainlessrc` file in JSON or YAML format
- A `.stainlessrc.json`, `.stainlessrc.yaml`, `.stainlessrc.yml`, `.stainlessrc.js`, or `.stainlessrc.cjs` file
- A `stainless.config.js` or `stainless.config.cjs` CommonJS module

#### Configuration Schema

```typescript
interface StainlessConfig {
   // Map of SDK names to their repository URLs
   // If using the main branch, then you will want to use the production SDK repo
   // If using non-main, eg <username>/dev, then you will want to use the staging SDK repo
   // e.g. git@github.com:stainless-sdks/<project>-typescript.git
   // The key is used as the <sdk-name> in the CLI
  stainlessSdkRepos: {
    [key: string]: string;
  };

  defaults?: {
    // Default branch name for all SDKs (required if not using cli flag)
    // If using the production SDK repo, then you will want to use the main branch
    // If using the staging SDK repo, then you will want to use the <username>/dev branch
    // See: https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/guides/branches
    branch?: string;
    
    // Default target directory for generated SDKs (can use {sdk} placeholder; required if not using cli flag) 
    targetDir?: string;
    
    // OpenAPI specification file path (required if not using cli flag)
    openApiFile: string;
    
    // Optional: Stainless config file
    stainlessConfigFile?: string;

    // Stainless project name (required if not using cli flag)
    projectName?: string;

    // Whether to use the "Guess with AI" command from the Stainless Studio for the Stainless Config
    guessConfig?: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### Example Configuration

```javascript
// stainless.config.js
module.exports = {
  stainlessSdkRepos: {
    typescript: 'git@github.com:stainless-sdks/yourproject-typescript.git',
  },
  defaults: {
    branch: 'main',
    targetDir: './sdks/{sdk}',
    openApiFile: './specs/openapi.yml',
    stainlessConfigFile: './stainless.config.yml',
    projectName: 'my-project',
    guessConfig: false
  }
};
```

## Generate Command

The `generate` command is the primary feature of Stainless Tools. It will clone (or update if exists) an SDK repository to a target directory, publish the OpenAPI file and Stainless Config file to the Stainless Config repo, and continuously monitor for changes to the SDK repository, pulling in new changes when detected.

### Usage

```bash
stainless-tools generate [options] <sdk-name>

Arguments:
  sdk-name     Name of the SDK to generate

Options:
  -b, --branch <n>                Branch name to use (required if not in config)
  -t, --target-dir <dir>          Target directory for the SDK (required if not in config)
  -o, --open-api-file <file>      Required: OpenAPI specification file
  -c, --config <file>             Configuration file path
  -s, --stainless-config-file <file> Optional: Stainless configuration file
  -p, --project-name <n>       Project name for Stainless API (required when using --open-api-file)
  -g, --guess-config              Uses the "Guess with AI" command from the Stainless Studio for the Stainless Config if enabled
  -h, --help                      Display help for command

### Examples

```bash
# Minimal required options (when no config file)
stainless-tools generate \
  --branch yourusername/dev \
  --open-api-file ./api-spec.json \
  --project-name my-project \
  typescript

# If using a config file with all defaults
stainless-tools generate typescript  # Uses defaults from config

# Using all CLI options
stainless-tools generate \
  --branch yourusername/dev \
  --target-dir ./sdks/typescript \
  --open-api-file ./api-spec.json \
  --project-name my-project \
  --config ./stainless.config.js \
  --guess-config \
  typescript
```

### How It Works

When you run `generate`:
1. It checks if the SDK repository exists in your target directory:
   - If the directory doesn't exist, it clones the repository fresh against the specified `branch`
   - If the directory exists and contains the correct repository, it updates it
   - If the directory exists but contains a different repository, it fails with an error asking you to remove it manually

2. If you provide an OpenAPI file (`--open-api-file`) or Stainless config file (`--stainless-config-file`):
   - It publishes these files to the Stainless Config repo via the Stainless API
   - The API processes the files and generates the SDK in the *staging* branch of the SDK repo

3. Continuously monitors for changes:
   - Pulls new SDK generation changes when detected
   - If you have local changes in your SDK clone:
     - Your changes are automatically stashed before pulling
     - After pulling, your changes are reapplied
     - If there are conflicts during reapply:
       - Your changes are preserved in the stash
       - You'll get instructions for resolving conflicts manually
   - When the OpenAPI or Stainless config files are updated:
     - Changes are automatically published to the Stainless Config repo
     - The API regenerates the SDK
     - New changes are pulled into your local clone (with stashing if needed)

4. Handles interruptions gracefully:
   - Ctrl+C stops the monitoring process
   - Any stashed changes are restored before exit
   - Cleanup is performed to ensure no watchers are left running
