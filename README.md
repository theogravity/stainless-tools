A TypeScript library and CLI tool for managing [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/) config and generated SDKs. This tool helps you generate, monitor, and sync SDK repositories as you update your OpenAPI / Stainless config files.

## Features

- üîÑ Clone and monitor SDK repositories for changes
- üìÑ Automatic OpenAPI specification file handling
- ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible configuration using cosmiconfig
- üîí Support for both HTTPS and SSH git URLs
- üöÄ Easy-to-use CLI interface
- üì¶ Can be used as a library in your own projects
- üéØ Default configurations for easier usage
- üîë Integration with Stainless API for publishing changes

## About this project

This `src` files were entirely built using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). It took an entire day with careful prompting to cover various use-cases and write the appropriate tests and documentation. No human wrote any part of the `src` code, although the README has been hand-polished.

It has only been tested on MacOS under Node 22 (although built for 18). Other platforms may not be supported.

## Installation

You must have at least Node 18 installed to use this tool.

```bash
npm install stainless-tools -g
```

## Staging vs Production Repositories

Each SDK can have two repository URLs:
- `staging`: Used for development and testing (typically in the `stainless-sdks` organization)
- `prod`: Used for production releases (typically in your organization)

By default, the tool uses the `staging` URL. To use the production URL, add the `--prod` flag:

```bash
# Development/testing: uses staging URL
stainless-tools generate typescript

# Production: uses production URL
stainless-tools generate --prod typescript
```

Typical workflow:
1. Use staging repositories for development and testing
2. Use production repositories for releasing to users

For example:
```javascript
{
  "stainlessSdkRepos": {
    "typescript": {
      // For development/testing
      "staging": "git@github.com:stainless-sdks/my-api-typescript.git",
      // For production releases
      "prod": "git@github.com:my-org/my-api-typescript.git"
    }
  }
}
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Write access to the SDK repository you want to generate
- A Stainless API key. This is the same API key used for automating updates via [GitHub Action](https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/guides/automate-updates#option-1-github-action-recommended)
- Have access to the generated SDK Repo as it will be checked out: `https://github.com/stainless-sdks/<project_name>-<language>`

#### Environment Setup

Before using the tool, you need to set up your environment variables. You can do this in two ways:

1. Create a `.env` file (or `.env.override` if you auto-generate your `.env` file) in your project root:
```bash
STAINLESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
STAINLESS_SDK_BRANCH=your_branch_name # Optional: Override the branch name
```

2. Or export them in your shell:
```bash
export STAINLESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export STAINLESS_SDK_BRANCH=your_branch_name # Optional: the git branch name to check out for the SDK repo
```

The `STAINLESS_SDK_BRANCH` environment variable is optional and can be used to override the branch name specified in the configuration file or command line options.

### Configuration

The tool uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) for configuration management. You can define your configuration in any of these ways:

- A `stainless-tools` property in package.json
- A `.stainless-toolsrc` file in JSON or YAML format
- A `.stainless-toolsrc.json`, `.stainless-toolsrc.yaml`, `.stainless-toolsrc.yml`, `.stainless-toolsrc.js`, or `.stainless-toolsrc.cjs` file
- A `stainless-tools.config.js` or `stainless-tools.config.cjs` CommonJS module

#### Configuration Schema

```typescript
interface StainlessConfig {
  // Map of SDK names to their repository URLs
  // Each SDK can have a staging and/or production URL
  // By default, the staging URL is used, but you can use --prod to use the production URL
  stainlessSdkRepos: {
    [key: string]: {
      // The staging URL is used by default
      staging?: string;
      // The production URL is used when --prod is specified
      prod?: string;
    };
  };

  defaults?: {
    // Default branch name for all SDKs (required if not using cli flag or the STAINLESS_SDK_BRANCH environment variable)
    // Typically use 'main' for production and '<username>/dev' for staging
    // See: https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/guides/branches
    branch?: string;

    // Default target directory for generated SDKs (can use {sdk} placeholder; required if not using cli flag) 
    targetDir?: string;

    // OpenAPI specification file path (required if not using cli flag)
    openApiFile: string;

    // Optional: Stainless config file path
    stainlessConfigFile?: string;

    // Stainless project name (required if not using cli flag)
    projectName?: string;

    // Whether to use the "Guess with AI" command from the Stainless Studio for the Stainless Config. Default is false.
    guessConfig?: boolean;
  };
}
```

#### Example Configuration

```javascript
// stainless-tools.config.js
module.exports = {
  stainlessSdkRepos: {
    typescript: {
      // Used by default
      staging: 'git@github.com:stainless-sdks/yourproject-typescript-staging.git',
      // Used when --prod is specified
      prod: 'git@github.com:stainless-sdks/yourproject-typescript.git',
    },
  },
  defaults: {
    branch: 'main',
    targetDir: './sdks/{sdk}',
    openApiFile: './specs/openapi.yml',
    stainlessConfigFile: './stainless-tools.config.yml',
    projectName: 'my-project',
    guessConfig: false
  }
};
```

## Generate Command

The `generate` command is the primary feature of Stainless Tools. It will clone (or update if exists) an SDK repository to a target directory, publish the OpenAPI file and Stainless Config file to the Stainless Config repo, and continuously monitor for changes to the SDK repository, pulling in new changes when detected.

### Usage

```bash
stainless-tools generate [options] <sdk-name>

Arguments:
  sdk-name     Name of the SDK to generate

Options:
  -b, --branch <n>                Branch name to use (required if not in config)
  -t, --target-dir <dir>          Target directory for the SDK (required if not in config)
  -o, --open-api-file <file>      Required: OpenAPI specification file
  -c, --config <file>             Configuration file path
  -s, --stainless-config-file <file> Optional: Stainless configuration file
  -p, --project-name <n>          Project name for Stainless API (required when using --open-api-file)
  -g, --guess-config              Uses the "Guess with AI" command from the Stainless Studio for the Stainless Config if enabled
  --prod                          Use production URLs instead of staging URLs
  -h, --help                      Display help for command

### Examples

```bash
# Using staging URL (default)
stainless-tools generate typescript

# Using production URL
stainless-tools generate --prod typescript

# Minimal required options (when no config file)
stainless-tools generate \
  --branch yourusername/dev \
  --open-api-file ./api-spec.json \
  --project-name my-project \
  typescript

# Using all CLI options with production URL
stainless-tools generate \
  --prod \
  --branch main \
  --target-dir ./sdks/typescript \
  --open-api-file ./api-spec.json \
  --project-name my-project \
  --config ./stainless-tools.config.js \
  --guess-config \
  typescript
```

### Staging vs Production Repositories

Each SDK can have two repository URLs:
- `staging`: Used for development and testing
- `prod`: Used for production releases

By default, the tool uses the `staging` URL. To use the production URL, add the `--prod` flag:

```bash
# Uses staging URL
stainless-tools generate typescript

# Uses production URL
stainless-tools generate --prod typescript
```

For example:
```javascript
{
  "stainlessSdkRepos": {
    "typescript": {
      // Staging repo
      "staging": "git@github.com:stainless-sdks/my-api-typescript.git",
      // Production repo
      "prod": "git@github.com:my-org/my-api-typescript.git"
    }
  }
}
```

### How It Works

When you run `generate`:
1. It checks if the SDK repository exists in your target directory:
    - If the directory doesn't exist, it clones the repository fresh against the specified `branch`
    - If the directory exists and contains the correct repository, it updates it
    - If the directory exists but contains a different repository, it fails with an error asking you to remove it manually

2. If you provide an OpenAPI file (`--open-api-file`) or Stainless config file (`--stainless-config-file`):
    - It publishes these files to the Stainless Config repo via the Stainless API
    - The API processes the files and generates the SDK in the *staging* branch of the SDK repo

3. Continuously monitors for changes:
    - Pulls new SDK generation changes when detected
    - If you have local changes in your SDK clone:
        - Your changes are automatically stashed before pulling
        - After pulling, your changes are reapplied
        - If there are conflicts during reapply:
            - Your changes are preserved in the stash
            - You'll get instructions for resolving conflicts manually
    - When the OpenAPI or Stainless config files are updated:
        - Changes are automatically published to the Stainless Config repo
        - The API regenerates the SDK
        - New changes are pulled into your local clone (with stashing if needed)

4. Handles interruptions gracefully:
    - Ctrl+C stops the monitoring process
    - Any stashed changes are restored before exit
    - Cleanup is performed to ensure no watchers are left running
