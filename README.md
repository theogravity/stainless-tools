## About this project

This `src` files were entirely built using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). It took an entire day with careful prompting to cover various use-cases and write the appropriate tests and documentation. No human wrote any part of the `src` code, although the README has been hand-polished.

It has only been tested on MacOS under Node 22 (although built for 18). Other platforms may not be supported.

## Installation

You must have at least Node 18 installed to use this tool.

```bash
npm install stainless-tools -g
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have:
- Write access to the SDK repository you want to generate
- A Stainless API key. This is the same API key used for automating updates via [GitHub Action](https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/guides/automate-updates#option-1-github-action-recommended)
- Have access to the generated SDK Repo as it will be checked out: `https://github.com/stainless-sdks/<project_name>-<language>`

#### Environment Setup

Before using the tool, you need to set up your environment variables. You can do this in two ways:

1. Create a `.env` file (or `.env.override` if you auto-generate your `.env` file) in your project root:
```bash
STAINLESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Or export them in your shell:
```bash
export STAINLESS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Configuration

The tool uses [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig) for configuration management. You can define your configuration in any of these ways:

- A `stainless-tools` property in package.json
- A `.stainless-toolsrc` file in JSON or YAML format
- A `.stainless-toolsrc.json`, `.stainless-toolsrc.yaml`, `.stainless-toolsrc.yml`, `.stainless-toolsrc.js`, or `.stainless-toolsrc.cjs` file
- A `stainless-tools.config.js` or `stainless-tools.config.cjs` CommonJS module

### Configuration Schema

```typescript
interface StainlessConfig {
  // Map of SDK names to their repository URLs
  // Each SDK can have a staging and/or production URL
  // By default, the staging URL is used, but you can use --prod to use the production URL
  stainlessSdkRepos: {
    [key: string]: {
      // The staging URL is used by default
      staging?: string;
      // The production URL is used when --prod is specified
      prod?: string;
    };
  };

  // Optional lifecycle hooks for each SDK
  // These commands are executed at specific points in the SDK lifecycle
  lifecycle?: {
    [key: string]: {
      // Command to run after cloning/updating the repository
      // Useful for installing dependencies, building, etc.
      postClone: string;
    };
  };

  defaults?: {
    // Default branch name for all SDKs (required if not using cli flag or the STAINLESS_SDK_BRANCH environment variable)
    // Typically use 'main' for production and '<username>/dev' for staging
    // See: https://app.stainlessapi.com/docs/guides/branches
    branch?: string;

    // Default target directory for generated SDKs. Supports the following template variables:
    // - {sdk}: The name of the SDK being generated
    // - {env}: The environment (staging/prod) being used
    // - {branch}: The git branch name (forward slashes converted to hyphens)
    targetDir?: string;

    // Default OpenAPI specification file location
    openApiFile?: string;

    // Default Stainless configuration file
    stainlessConfigFile?: string;

    // Whether to use the "Guess with AI" command from the Stainless Studio for the Stainless Config
    guessConfig?: boolean;

    // Default project name
    projectName?: string;
  };
}
```

### Target Directory Templates

The `targetDir` configuration supports template variables that are dynamically replaced when generating SDKs:

- `{sdk}`: Replaced with the name of the SDK being generated
- `{env}`: Replaced with the current environment (`staging` or `prod`)
- `{branch}`: Replaced with the git branch name (forward slashes are converted to hyphens for filesystem compatibility)

This allows you to organize your SDKs in a structured way. For example:

```javascript
{
  defaults: {
    targetDir: './sdks/{env}/{sdk}/{branch}'
  }
}
```

Would generate directories like:
- `./sdks/staging/typescript/main`
- `./sdks/prod/typescript/main`
- `./sdks/staging/python/theogravity-dev` (from branch `theogravity/dev`)

This is particularly useful when working with multiple SDKs, environments, and branches simultaneously. Note that forward slashes in branch names are automatically converted to hyphens to ensure filesystem compatibility across different platforms.

### Example Configuration

```javascript
// stainless-tools.config.js
module.exports = {
  stainlessSdkRepos: {
    typescript: {
      // Used by default
      staging: 'git@github.com:stainless-sdks/yourproject-typescript-staging.git',
      // Used when --prod is specified
      prod: 'git@github.com:stainless-sdks/yourproject-typescript.git',
    },
  },
  defaults: {
    branch: 'main',
    // Organize SDKs by environment, name, and branch
    targetDir: './sdks/{env}/{sdk}/{branch}',
    openApiFile: './specs/openapi.yml',
    stainlessConfigFile: './stainless-tools.config.yml',
    projectName: 'my-project',
    guessConfig: false
  }
};
```

### Lifecycle Hooks

The tool supports lifecycle hooks that allow you to automate tasks after certain operations. Currently supported hooks:

#### postClone

The `postClone` hook runs after:
- Initial clone of an SDK repository

This hook is useful for:
- Installing dependencies
- Running initial build scripts
- Setting up the development environment

#### postUpdate

The `postUpdate` hook runs after:
- Pulling new changes from the remote repository
- And after restoring any stashed local changes (if there were any)

This hook is useful for:
- Rebuilding after updates
- Running database migrations
- Updating dependencies
- Running tests against new changes

### Lifecycle Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured in the `lifecycle` section of your configuration file:

```javascript
// stainless-tools.config.js
module.exports = {
  stainlessSdkRepos: {
    typescript: {
      staging: 'git@github.com:stainless-sdks/yourproject-typescript-staging.git',
      prod: 'git@github.com:stainless-sdks/yourproject-typescript.git',
    },
  },
  lifecycle: {
    typescript: {
      // Run after initial clone
      postClone: 'npm install && npm run build',
      // Run after pulling new changes
      postUpdate: 'npm run build',
    },
    python: {
      postClone: 'python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .',
      postUpdate: 'source venv/bin/activate && pip install -e .',
    },
  },
};
```

The hook commands:
- Run from the SDK repository directory
- Have access to a shell (so you can use &&, ||, etc.)
- Will cause the tool to exit with an error if the command fails
- Have access to the following environment variables:
  - `STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_PATH`: Full path to the cloned SDK repository
  - `STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_BRANCH`: Name of the current branch
  - `STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_REPO_NAME`: Name of the SDK repository (e.g., "typescript", "python")

Example using environment variables:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  lifecycle: {
    typescript: {
      // Use environment variables to avoid hardcoding paths
      postClone: 'cd $STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_PATH && npm install && npm run build',
      // Log the current branch during updates
      postUpdate: 'echo "Updating SDK on branch $STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_BRANCH" && npm run build'
    }
  }
};
```

You can also use external scripts:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  lifecycle: {
    typescript: {
      postClone: './scripts/setup-sdk.sh',  // Script has access to env vars
      postUpdate: './scripts/update-sdk.sh'
    }
  }
};
```

Example setup script (`setup-sdk.sh`):
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Setting up $STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_REPO_NAME SDK in $STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_PATH"
cd "$STAINLESS_TOOLS_SDK_PATH"

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run build
npm run build

# Additional setup steps...
```

## Generate Command

The `generate` command is the primary feature of Stainless Tools. It will clone (or update if exists) an SDK repository to a target directory, publish the OpenAPI file and Stainless Config file to the Stainless Config repo, and continuously monitor for changes to the SDK repository, pulling in new changes when detected.

### Usage

```bash
stainless-tools generate [options] <sdk-name>

Arguments:
  sdk-name     Name of the SDK to generate

Options:
  -b, --branch <name>                Branch name to use (required if not in config)
  -t, --target-dir <dir>             Target directory for the SDK (required if not in config)
  -o, --open-api-file <file>         OpenAPI specification file
  -c, --config <file>                Configuration file path
  -s, --stainless-config-file <file> Stainless configuration file
  -p, --project-name <name>          Project name for Stainless API (required if not in config)
  -g, --guess-config                 Uses the "Guess with AI" command from the Stainless Studio for the Stainless Config if enabled
  --prod                             Use production URLs instead of staging URLs
  -h, --help                         Display help for command

### Examples

```bash
# Using staging URL (default) with config file fully defined
stainless-tools generate typescript

# Using production URL (typically with main branch)
stainless-tools generate typescript \
  --prod \
  --branch main

# Minimal required options (when no defaults defined in config file)
stainless-tools generate \
  --branch yourusername/dev \
  --open-api-file ./api-spec.json \
  --project-name my-project \
  typescript

# Using all CLI options with production URL
stainless-tools generate \
  --prod \
  --branch main \
  --target-dir ./sdks/typescript \
  --open-api-file ./api-spec.json \
  --project-name my-project \
  --config ./stainless-tools.config.js \
  --guess-config \
  typescript
```

### Branch Configuration and Environments

Each SDK supports two environments with separate repositories:
- `staging`: For development and testing, typically using `yourusername/dev` branch
- `prod`: For production releases, typically using `main` branch

The branch name must be specified through one of these methods (in order of precedence):
1. Command line: `--branch yourusername/dev`
2. Environment: `STAINLESS_SDK_BRANCH=yourusername/dev`
3. Config defaults: `defaults.branch` in your config file

Example configuration:
```json5
{
  "stainlessSdkRepos": {
    "typescript": {
      "staging": "git@github.com:stainless-sdks/my-api-typescript.git",
      "prod": "git@github.com:my-org/my-api-typescript.git"
    }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "branch": "yourusername/dev"  // Default branch if not specified via CLI or env
  }
}
```

Basic usage:
```bash
# Development: Uses staging URL (default)
stainless-tools generate typescript

# Production: Uses prod URL with main branch
stainless-tools generate typescript \
  --prod \
  --branch main
```

### How It Works

When you run `generate`:
1. It checks if the SDK repository exists in your target directory:
    - If the directory doesn't exist, it clones the repository fresh against the specified `branch`
    - If the directory exists and contains the correct repository, it updates it
    - If the directory exists but contains a different repository, it fails with an error asking you to remove it manually

2. If you provide an OpenAPI file (`--open-api-file`) or Stainless config file (`--stainless-config-file`):
    - It publishes these files to the Stainless Config repo via the Stainless API
    - The API processes the files and generates the SDK in the *staging* branch of the SDK repo

3. Continuously monitors for changes:
    - Pulls new SDK generation changes when detected
    - If you have local changes in your SDK clone:
        - Your changes are automatically stashed before pulling
        - After pulling, your changes are reapplied
        - If there are conflicts during reapply:
            - Your changes are preserved in the stash
            - You'll get instructions for resolving conflicts manually
    - When the OpenAPI or Stainless config files are updated:
        - Changes are automatically published to the Stainless Config repo
        - The API regenerates the SDK
        - New changes are pulled into your local clone (with stashing if needed)

4. Handles interruptions gracefully:
    - Ctrl+C stops the monitoring process
    - Any stashed changes are restored before exit
    - Cleanup is performed to ensure no watchers are left running

## Publish Specs Command

The `publish-specs` command allows you to publish your OpenAPI specification and Stainless configuration directly to Stainless, making it easy to update your SDK configuration without using the web interface.

### Usage

```bash
stainless-tools publish-specs [options] <sdk-name>

Arguments:
  sdk-name     Name of the SDK to publish specifications for

Options:
  -b, --branch <branch>                Git branch to use
  -t, --target-dir <dir>               Directory where the SDK will be generated
  -o, --open-api-file <file>           Path to OpenAPI specification file
  -c, --config <file>                  Path to configuration file
  -s, --stainless-config-file <file>   Path to Stainless-specific configuration
  -p, --project-name <name>               Name of the project in Stainless
  -g, --guess-config                   Use AI to guess configuration
  --prod                               Use production URLs instead of staging
```

### Examples

```bash
stainless-tools publish-specs typescript

# With custom configuration
stainless-tools publish-specs typescript \
  --open-api-file openapi.json \
  --config config.json

# With project name
stainless-tools publish-specs \
  --project-name my-project \
  --open-api-file openapi.json \
  typescript

# With Stainless-specific configuration
stainless-tools publish-specs \
  --stainless-config-file stainless.config.json \
  --open-api-file openapi.json \
  typescript
```

When you run `publish-specs`:

1. The command validates your input and configuration
2. Reads the OpenAPI specification file
3. Reads the Stainless configuration file (if provided)
4. Validates the configuration format
5. Publishes the files to Stainless using your API key

The publish-specs command is particularly useful for:
- CI/CD pipelines where you want to automate SDK updates
- Local development when you want to quickly update your SDK configuration
- Testing new API changes before committing them to production
